# Employee Tracker SQL App

![license-badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-None-blue)

## Description
This command line application allows the user to add and view departments, roles, and employees as well as update a specific employee's role. When the app is opened in the terminal, the user is then shown a menu of options to select (listed above). After each addition or viewing of the desired table, the user is then shown the menu again if they would like to continue viewing, adding or updating, or if they would like to exit the application. The application utilizes MySQL in order to store the user's input into a database and this allows them to access that information even after the application has been quit and then restarted.
